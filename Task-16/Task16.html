            The p tag is an important element in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) used to define and represent a paragraph of text
            within a webpage. The name "p" stands for "paragraph," and it is one of the most commonly used tags for organizing
            and structuring textual content on the web.

        <p style="color: bisque;">
            When you enclose a block of text within p opening and closing tags, you are signaling to web browsers that the
            enclosed content should be treated as a separate paragraph. Browsers will typically render
            p tags by adding vertical spacing before and after the paragraph, creating a clear visual distinction between
            paragraphs.
